## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The application follows the standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

### Models
Define data structures and business logic
- `ApplicationUser.cs`: User model extending ASP.NET Identity
- `Room.cs`: Classroom definitions
- `Booking.cs`: Reservation data structure (with nullable navigation properties)
- `AuditLog.cs`: System activity tracking (with nullable User property)

### Views
User interface components
- Organized by controller (Home, Rooms, Bookings)
- Shared layouts and partial views

### Controllers
Handle user interactions
- `HomeController.cs`: Dashboard and basic pages
- `RoomsController.cs`: Room management
- `BookingsController.cs`: Booking functionality with proper entity loading

### Data
Database context and initialization
- `ApplicationDbContext.cs`: EF Core database context
- `DbInitializer.cs`: Seed data and initial setup

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses several key tables:

1. **AspNetUsers**: User accounts (extended from ASP.NET Identity)
2. **Rooms**: Available classrooms and their properties
3. **Bookings**: Reservation records linking users to rooms
4. **AuditLogs**: System activity tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Create or modify models as needed
2. Update the database context and add migrations
3. Implement controller actions
4. Create or update views
5. Test thoroughly across different user roles

### Database Migrations
When making changes to the data model:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
dotnet ef database update
```

## üêõ Recent Fixes

   - Explicitly loaded Room and User entities in the POST Edit method

3. Added missing CreateForRoom functionality:

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify connection string in appsettings.json
   - Ensure SQL Server is running
   - Check if the database exists

2. **Migration Errors**
   - Try removing the Migrations folder and recreating migrations
   - Check for model errors or constraints

3. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check application logs in the logs directory
   - Verify permissions for operations

## Extending the Application

The Classroom Scheduler can be extended in several ways:
